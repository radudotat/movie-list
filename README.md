## Functional Requirements

- The user can type a year in this input box to search for movies released in that year.
- Search functionality should fetch data from 'https://jsonmock.hackerrank.com/api/movies'. Use 'year' as filtering parameter.
- Please, think about edge cases

## Structure

Project structure is totally up to you. We expect you think about current request but also potential future modifications

## Testing Requirements

We do not care about test coverage number! However, we do care about "a proper and meaningful" test coverage.
Do whatever it takes to have a proper maintainability.
